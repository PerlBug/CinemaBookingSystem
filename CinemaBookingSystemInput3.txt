#this test was designed to test if a changing a booking would check if its a valid booking first before
#de-assigning, and it would also check if it would assign the new booking after it has cancelled the old booking
#or if it would assign seats then free old booking
#behaviour should be de-assign -> assign not assign ->deassign
